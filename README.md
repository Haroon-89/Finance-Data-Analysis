# Finance Data Project

## Overview
This project focuses on **exploratory data analysis** of stock prices, specifically analyzing the trends and performance of major bank stocks over time. The primary goal is to practice **data visualization** and **pandas skills** rather than conducting a full-fledged financial analysis. This project is not intended for financial decision-making or investment advice.

## Project Scope
We'll analyze how bank stocks performed during the financial crisis and track their recovery up to early 2016.

## Learning Goals
- Working with **pandas** for data manipulation
- Performing **exploratory data analysis (EDA)**
- Using **plotly & cufflinks** for interactive visualizations
- Handling **multi-index data structures** in pandas
- Understanding **moving averages** and **financial indicators**

## Dataset
The dataset consists of historical stock prices of major banks, including:
- **Bank of America (BAC)**
- **Citigroup (C)**
- **Goldman Sachs (GS)**
- **JPMorgan Chase (JPM)**
- **Morgan Stanley (MS)**
- **Wells Fargo (WFC)**

## Project Challenges
This project is designed to be **challenging** and will introduce:
- Advanced **data manipulation** techniques
- Creating **multi-index** DataFrames
- Implementing **financial indicators** like **Simple Moving Averages (SMA)**
- Interactive **data visualization** with Plotly & Cufflinks

## Installation & Setup
